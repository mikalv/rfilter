= Changes in RubyFilter 0.10 (released 2003-02-04)

- Add RFilter::Deliver.write_to_mbox that writes to an already open
  mailbox file.  This can be used when none of the anal checks,
  locking, etc. that RFilter::Deliver.deliver_mbox does is
  desireable.

- Add RFilter::KeyedMailbox#each_key and
  RFilter::KeyedMailbox#key_mtime methods that can be used to
  implement expiry when you want to process the message before it is
  deleted.

- DeliveryAgent#deliver_mbox now ignores the SIGXFSZ exception and
  recovers from the EFBIG Errno exception.

= Changes in RubyFilter 0.9 (released 2002-01-16)

- New DeliveryAgent#filter method that can be used to filter a message
  through an external command, possibly changing the message.

- DeliveryAgent::DeliveryPipeFailure renamed to
  DeliveryAgent::DeliveryCommandFailure since it is now raised by
  DeliveryAgent#pipe as well as DeliveryAgent#filter.

- DeliveryAgent#defer and DeliveryAgent#reject now have a default
  argument for the message string.

- Other changes to bring up to date with current RubyMail and Ruby
  1.8.0.

= Changes in RubyFilter 0.8 (released 2002-03-18)

- Created from RubyMail 0.7

- All Mail::* constants moved into the RFilter:: module.

- Mail::Deliver.deliver_mbox returns the name of the file delivered
  to.

- rdeliver.rb now prints DeliveryDever and DeliveryReject messages to
  stdout in the hopes that the MTA will include them in the bounce
  message.

- Renamed Mail::LDA to RFilter::DeliveryAgent.

- RFilter::Deliver.deliver_maildir -- bring in line with the
  Maildir delivery spec (i.e. stat the tmp file before trying to open
  it instead of relying on O_EXCL).
