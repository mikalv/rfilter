= RubyFilter

This is a framework for filtering mail, possibly modifying it, and
delivering it to various mailbox formats.

RubyFilter is available at:

    http://www.lickey.com/rubyfilter/

RubyFilter depends on RubyMail, available at:

    http://www.lickey.com/rubymail/

= Why?

The world needs alternatives to procmail.  I wanted one that allowed
me to write a mail filter in a fully capable scripting language.

= Status

This package is currently very raw.  All API is subject to change.  I
very much appreciate suggestions and comments.

However, I do use this for all of my own mail filtering.

= Requirements

Ruby 1.6.* or Ruby 1.8.*.  Only tested under Linux, should be fine
under any Unix.

= Documentation

See the doc/ subdirectory for HTML documentation.

= Install

Type the following while in the package directory:

  ruby install.rb config
  ruby install.rb setup
  ruby install.rb install

You may need special permissions to execute the last line.  If you
want to just install RubyMail to a custom location, just copy the
rmail subdirectory manually.

= Tests?

This package has a complete unit test suite (requires RubyUnit to
run).
