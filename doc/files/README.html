<div class="description"><h1>RubyFilter</h1>
<p>
This is a framework for filtering mail, possibly modifying it, and
delivering it to various mailbox formats.
</p>
<p>
RubyFilter is available at:
</p>
<pre>
    http://www.lickey.com/rubyfilter/
</pre>
<p>
RubyFilter depends on RubyMail, available at:
</p>
<pre>
    http://www.lickey.com/rubymail/
</pre>
<h1>Why?</h1>
<p>
The world needs alternatives to procmail. I wanted one that allowed me to
write a mail filter in a fully capable scripting language.
</p>
<h1>Status</h1>
<p>
This package is currently very raw. All API is subject to change. I very
much appreciate suggestions and comments.
</p>
<p>
However, I do use this for all of my own mail filtering.
</p>
<h1>Requirements</h1>
<p>
Ruby 1.6.* or Ruby 1.8.*. Only tested under Linux, should be fine under any
Unix.
</p>
<h1>Documentation</h1>
<p>
See the doc/ subdirectory for HTML documentation.
</p>
<h1>Install</h1>
<p>
Type the following while in the package directory:
</p>
<pre>
  ruby install.rb config
  ruby install.rb setup
  ruby install.rb install
</pre>
<p>
You may need special permissions to execute the last line. If you want to
just install RubyMail to a custom location, just copy the rmail
subdirectory manually.
</p>
<h1>Tests?</h1>
<p>
This package has a complete unit test suite (requires RubyUnit to run).
